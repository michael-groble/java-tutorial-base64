This is an introductory Java tutorial I made to highlight some language features:

- unit testing
- javadoc
- various control structures
- binary vs. character IO
- binary operators
- exceptions
- static initializers
- inner classes

There is a skeleton implementation file and a fully developed set of unit tests.  Your job is to fix the implementation to make all the tests pass.  Additional instructions are in the test file.

It is set up as an Eclipse project with Java 1.7.
